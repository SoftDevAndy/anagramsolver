# Countdown Letters Game Solver

This project is created for the Theory of Algorithms module as part of a fourth year project at G.M.I.T.

**Project Outline**

You are required to create two pieces: a Python script that solves the Countdown letters game, and a document explaining how your solver works. The Countdown letters game is as detailed on Wikipedia. Esentially, you are given a list of nine random letters which contains at least three vowels and four consonants. You must find the longest possible word in the Oxford English dictionary that is an anagram of some or all of the letters in the random list. If there is more than one word of longest length, then each is as acceptable a solution as the others.

**Instructions**

Find a list of words in the Oxford English dictionary. This won't be too easy - you might need to join a few different files together. You might even try scraping the Oxford Dictionary's website. If you write any scripts to do that, include them in your submission.

Write a Python script that solves the Countdown letters game in the most efficient way you can.

Write a README file (called _about.md in above gist) about your script.

Add to your Python script a function to test your algorithm, which creates a random list of nine letters as they would be generated in Countdown.
