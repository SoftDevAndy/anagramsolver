# Created for 4th year Theory of Algorithms project

# Parses a file of words and keeps only the words
# that are between 2 and 10 characters. It only adds
# words to the dictionary that contain no whitespaces,
# no numbers and no special characters.

# Only used for the creation of clean wordfiles for importing into the project
# Not meant to be efficient just a rough way to create the files the way I need them
